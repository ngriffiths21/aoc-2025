# Advent of Code 2025

## Puzzles

Day 1: Rotating dial with simple recursion and modular arithmetic

Day 2: Recursively construct repeating base-10 digit sequences in a given range

Day 3: Traverse sequence of digits to construct biggest number, using array pointers

Day 4: Find positions in a grid where neighboring positions are valid, checking with simple array pointer arithmetic

Day 5: Check membership in and size of a set of ranges, with a functional approach using immutable binary trees

Day 7: Scan through a branching structure while accounting for duplicate branches and their multiplicities

Input parsing using Menhir and Ocamllex, which is clearly overkill for most inputs but useful for anything complex.
